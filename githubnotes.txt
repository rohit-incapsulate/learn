local repo = my computer
global repo = github
master branch - local repo branch
To add and commit we can use signs of + and then type message or through terminal
using "git add ." and "git commit -a -m "New code added" "
Remote help us to add from local repo (pc) to global repo (github).
We have kept our remote name as origin so we push from origin to master branch using
"git push origin master".
To shift from master to new branch created ie new-story "git checkout new-story"
need to add our branch name in vscode to checkout.
