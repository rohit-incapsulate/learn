local repo = my computer
global repo = github
master branch - local repo branch
To add and commit we can use signs of + and then type message or through terminal
using "git add ." and "git commit -a -m "New code added" "
Remote help us to add from local repo (pc) to global repo (github).
We have kept our remote name as origin so we push from origin to master branch using
"git push origin master" or directly ... ->  pull/push -> push .
To shift from master to new branch created ie new-story "git checkout new-story"
need to add our branch name in vscode to checkout.

PR = Pull request..Apne kch pull karlia ab app kch dalne ki request karna chahte hai .
You created a branch..New branch some changes.. You want to request the owner of repo.. review..
if okay add it in ur main branch.

On github directly ui wala kaam click compare and pull request.
Keep note properly on which branch you are merging.

Git clone use "git clone codeurl". URL can be pasted using ctrl+shift+V. 

Pull using "git pull origin master" where origin is remote.

Remote is a lable for whichever repo you want to do pull/push, branch change ... remote is must needed..  By default we get "origin" as remote.
on typing "remote -v" in terminal.

origin  https://github.com/rohit-incapsulate/learn.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/rohit-incapsulate/learn.git (push)

If we want to remove remote use  "git remote remove origin".

To add remote -- either directly by ... -> remote -> Add/Remove remote or "git remote add url".

---------------
git stash -- like a box keep changes in that box and keep the box aside if needed later.
command "git stash -m "added a line in github file"... will get meaningful name then.

To see all inside stash use cmd "git stash list".
only latest stash will be pushed - "git stash apply".
To apply changes to specific stash use -- "git stash apply stash@{2}"

to delete particular stash - git stash drop stash@{2}
to delete all stash - git stash clear.

To create branch too while using stash -- git stash branch "nothing" stash@{0}.
create new branch and came on that branch did public using stash and drop that stash as well as phrr kch kaam nhi.
